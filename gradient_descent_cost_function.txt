Topic: ML | Gradient descent and cost function

Gradient descent:
-> It is an algorithm that finds best fit line for given training data set.
-> It plots the distinct 'slope' and 'intecept' value against MSE.
-> Then it find out for which 'm' and 'b' values the MSE value comes to zero.
-> Partial derivative of 'm' and 'b' gives the slope. more clearly it gives the direction.
-> To find out the next step distance use 'learning rate'.
-> b1 = b0 - learning rate * partial derivative of 'm' (or) 'b'.

Cost function:
-> Mean squared error is known as cost function.
